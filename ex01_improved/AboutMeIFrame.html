				Lara is a freelance web designer with satisfied clients worldwide. Lara has been designing websites professionally for over eight years, and is very keen on personal service. I would describe Lara as a spiritual fast learning generalist with a passion for remarkable design.
				<br><br>
				ThatÂ´s enough of talking about myself in the third person.
				<br><br>
				At first I intended to be an animator and went to design school fully motivated to become just that. One thing led to another and 2 years went by and I was a (almost) fully fledged freelance web designer without ever planning to become one.
				<br><br>
				I have sucessfully been a freelance web designer now for a while and it has given me even more love for this work. I have worked with ad agencies, web developers, diaper makers, pension funds, furniture makers, businiess women & men, friends & family.
